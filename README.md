# New Navigation Compose Example

This project demonstrates how to implement navigation with deep links in Jetpack Compose. It includes two main screens: a `HomeScreen` for displaying a list of items and a `DetailScreen` for showing detailed information about an item. The navigation supports both in-app navigation and deep linking.

## Features

- **In-app Navigation**: Navigate between screens within the app using `NavController`.
- **Deep Linking**: Handle deep links that allow navigation directly to the `DetailScreen` with a specific item using an `itemId`.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The app is built using Jetpack Compose, following modern Android development practices.
- **Hilt Dependency Injection**: The project uses Hilt for dependency injection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:
- Android Studio (latest stable version)
- Android SDK
- Kotlin (preferably the latest stable version)
